## Setup

### Python
First create a `virtual environment` and install all necessary packages by running the following command.

```python
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install .
```

### Documentation
The documentation relies on `pandoc` to function correctly. Therefore pandoc and a LateX Environment has to be installed. For MacOS run the following command. This assumes that you have `brew` installed:

```bash
brew install pandoc
brew install --cask mactex
```
After installing the necessary tools the corresponding PDFs can simply be generated by running the `bash files under the /doc directory`.

## Notebook
In order to run the Jupyter Notebook run the following command (assuming you have the virtual environment activated).

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks
```
